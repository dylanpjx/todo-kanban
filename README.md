# todo-kanban (WIP)

## Personal implementation of a todo kanban board.

Web app built with React as frontend. Only tested on Windows Firefox currently.

The main goal of this project is to create a component based single page React app. The project is also a platform to learn about web storage.

## Host the site yourself using `npm install` and `npm run build`
Alternatively, you can view the site [here](https://github.com/dylanpjx/todo-kanban)

## Features completed:
- Single board functionality with custom styles (Material UI)
- Board persistence using localStorage
- React beautiful dnd for nice dragging animations

## Advanced features planned:
- Support markdown syntax
- User authentication
- Use MongoDB to permanently store notes per user (Basic version will use localStorage)
- Multiple board per user with different formats (Paint-like canvas, Kanban, Normal notes)
- Ability to share/collab boards with other users (with real-time updates)
