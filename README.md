# todo-kanban

## Personal implementation of a todo kanban board.

Web app built with React as frontend. Only tested on Windows Firefox currently.

The main goal of this project is to create a component based single page React app. The project is also a platform to learn about web storage.

## Advanced features planned:

- User authentication
- Use MongoDB to permanently store notes per user
- Multiple board per user with different formats (Paint-like canvas and Kanban)
- Ability to share/collab boards with other users (with real-time updates)
